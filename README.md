# PyBer_Analysis

#Overview
The goal of this analysis it to use fare price, driver, and rider data across all city types to discover more efficient ways to distribute resources.

#Results
 - It is clear that urben areas have a much higher amount of rides than suburben and rural areas. One can assume this is a result of fewer people owning cars, however, additional data would be needed to confirm this. 
 - Rural areas have the fewist rides, but they have the highest average fair per ride.
 - Suburban areas are in the middle across the board, however, these areas are growing compaired to urban and rural areas.

#Summary

 - If we only have this data to go on it looks like the suburban areas have the most growth potential, and it could benefit from additional resourses to expand PyBer awarnes and availability.

 - Additional data is need to more acuratly see what areas have the greatest demand and potential for growth. 
     - For example:
          - Wait time for a driver to accept rides.
          - Number of drives dropped because there are no available drivers.
          - Average number of rides per dirver.
